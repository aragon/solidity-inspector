# solidity-inspector

### Repo has been deprecated in favor of a lighter extractor in aragon-dev-cli

## Old description

Forked from [solidity-structure](https://github.com/vitiko/solidity-structure) to extract aditional info as modifiers, access control modifiers, full [natspec](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Natural-Specification-Format) and other arbitrary info to make tools or documentation.

Parse structure of ethereum solidity contract, including enums,constructor, structs. Based on [Solidity Parser library](https://github.com/ConsenSys/solidity-parser) from [ConsenSys](https://github.com/ConsenSys).

The goal of it is to take Solidity code as input and return an object as output that can be used to describe _all_ parts of Solidity smart contract.
